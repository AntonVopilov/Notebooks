    "Sometimes it is better to use a low order ODE integrator and just hammer the number of steps, rather than a higher order integrator that requires fewer function calls.  The \"workhorse\" integrator for ODE's is probably the [fourth order Runge-Kutta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods), colloquially known as [RK4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods).  The lowest order method is Euler's method, which is normally introduced primarily to show how bad it is!  Here let's look at two methods which are second order and involve two derivative evaluations.\n",
