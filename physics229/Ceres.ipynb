    "In 1801 a young Gauss became an overnight sensation when he rediscovered the minor planet [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)), which had been \"lost\" by its discoverer (Piazzi) earlier that year.  You can read more of the history and his methodology [here](https://math.berkeley.edu/~mgu/MA221/Ceres_Presentation.pdf) and [here](http://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~cherlin/History/Papers1999/weiss.html).  In brief he was clever, he calculated by hand (for over 100 hours), and he invented the method of least squares.  We're not as clever and we'll use a computer, but we'll follow his lead and use the method of least squares too.  Hopefully this will take less than 100 hours!"
